# Common Package Installer
This is NOT a hacking tool, or anything like that. It is just a prototype that I'm going to be trying to make. Enjoy...?

## Installation
To install, run the following commands:

`apt update && apt upgrade`

`apt install git`

`git clone https://github.com/yoyeet961/termuxprototype`

`cd termuxprototype`

`ls`

`chmod +x pkginstall.sh`

`bash pkginstall.sh`

Done!

## FILL VERSION, DO NOT EXECUTE UNLESS YOU HAVE ENOUGH SPACE IN YOUR PHONE. THIS COULD TAKE UP AROUND 600 MB

`chmod +x fill.sh`

`bash fill.sh`

Done! Enjoy...?
